#  Apache Spark 

Welcome to my Spark Projects repository!  
This is my personal learning and showcase space where I solve handsâ€‘on Spark exercises using **PySpark** and **Spark SQL**.

##  About
This repo contains **20+ problems** covering a wide range of Spark concepts:
-  DataFrame and RDD APIs
-  Spark SQL queries
-  Transformations and Actions
-  Partitioning & Bucketing
-  Joins, Aggregations, and Window functions
-  Optimization techniques (broadcast joins, coalesce, cache, etc.)
-  Delta Lake concepts

Each problem is implemented as a standalone script/notebook with clear explanations and sample data
